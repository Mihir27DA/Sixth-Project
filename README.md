# Sixth-Project
In this project I used My SQL Workbench. Started with creating Database (Zomato) and creating 4 tables and running 5 given queries.

1. What is the total amount each customer spent on zomato?
2. How many days has each costumer visited zomato?
3. Determine the most purchased item on the menu and the number of times it was purchased by all customers?
4. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
5. What is the total orders and amount spent for each member before they become a gold member?
